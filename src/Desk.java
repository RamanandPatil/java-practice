/**
 * Code Challenge — Write a program
 * A university has decided to open math courses and equip classrooms for 3
 * groups with special new desks. The faculty agreed that in the sake of
 * productivity only two students may share one table. The enrolment has
 * ended, and now the task is to count the number of desks to order the
 * correct amount from the shop. Of course, the university is short of money,
 * so you need to calculate the minimum of desks. But don't forget that each
 * group will sit in its own classroom!
 *
 * Input data format
 *
 * The program receives the input of the three non-negative integers: the
 * number of students in each of the three groups (the numbers is not bigger
 * than 1000).
 *
 * Sample Input 1:
 *
 * 20
 * 21
 * 22
 * Sample Output 1:
 *
 * 32
 * Sample Input 2:
 *
 * 16
 * 18
 * 20
 * Sample Output 2:
 *
 * 27
