/**
 * Pie company
 *
 * You are asked to help with Java programming in a Pie company.
 *
 * At the moment they bake and sell pies, cakes and tarts packed in nice
 * boxes. Unfortunately, approach to boxes programming is quite outdated â€“
 * each pie type requires its own box class. This approach is poorly scalable
 * and will turn the situation into a nightmare with product range growth
 * (imagine all these ApplePieBox, StrawberryPieBox, etc.).
 *
 * To avoid this implement universal Box class that will accommodate anything
 * with put and give it back with getters.
 *
 * Use the provided code template, don't remove existing classes.
